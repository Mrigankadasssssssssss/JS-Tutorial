****** Theory ********

There are 7 types of data types

1. Number -> 2,5,8,88564887,23.5659

2. String -> "Double Quoted String" , 'Single Quoted String'

3. Boolean -> true/false

4. Null -> Intentionally absence of the value

5.Undefined -> Variable Declared But Not Initiallized

Note: The diff b/w null and undefined
        undefined: typically represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned or a function parameter that has not been provided.
        null: is often used to indicate that a variable intentionally does not have an object value.

6.Objects -> Complex Data Structure

7.Symbol

// Examples

//console.log(typeof (5465.3))  -> Numbers

//console.log(typeof ("Mriganka")) -> String

//console.log(typeof (true)) -> Boolean

//let a = null
//console.log(typeof (a)) //It's important to note that null is its own primitive type in JavaScript, and it should ideally have a typeof result of "null". However, due to historical reasons and for the sake of backward compatibility, the typeof null returns "object".

//let a
//console.log(a) -> undefined
